## 🎨 Custom Component Implementation

### ParallaxBackground
The animated background uses a combination of CSS and Framer Motion to create a dynamic, layered parallax effect:

```typescript
// Key features:
- Multiple layered divs with different movement speeds
- CSS transform with translate3d for hardware acceleration
- Framer Motion's useScroll hook for scroll-based animation
- Gradient overlays for depth and atmosphere
- Blur effects for glassmorphism
- Smooth opacity transitions for fade in/out
```

### ShinyCTA
The shiny button effect is created using a combination of CSS gradients and animations:

```typescript
// Key features:
- Gradient background with multiple color stops
- Animated gradient position using CSS keyframes
- Hover state with scale transform
- Glow effect using box-shadow
- Smooth transitions for all properties
- Glassmorphism effect with backdrop-blur

// Known Issues:
- Disabled state implementation of shiny CTA can cause visual glitches
- Scrolling in influncer card section
```

### Implementation Details

#### ParallaxBackground
1. **Layer Structure**
   - Base layer with slow movement
   - Middle layer with medium movement
   - Top layer with fast movement
   - Overlay layer for color and blur effects

2. **Animation Logic**
   ```typescript
   const { scrollYProgress } = useScroll();
   const y = useTransform(scrollYProgress, [0, 1], [0, -100]);
   ```

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Hardware acceleration with transform3d
   - Will-change property for better performance
   - Debounced scroll calculations
   - Conditional rendering based on viewport

#### ShinyCTA
1. **Gradient Animation**
   ```css
   background: linear-gradient(
     45deg,
     rgba(255,255,255,0.1) 0%,
     rgba(255,255,255,0.2) 50%,
     rgba(255,255,255,0.1) 100%
   );
   background-size: 200% 200%;
   animation: shine 3s infinite;
   ```

2. **Hover Effects**
   ```css
   &:hover {
     transform: scale(1.05);
     box-shadow: 0 0 30px rgba(255,255,255,0.2);
   }
   ```

3. **Glassmorphism**
   ```css
   backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
   background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1);
   border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.2);
   ```

### Best Practices
1. **Performance**
   - Use transform instead of position properties
   - Implement will-change for better performance
   - Debounce scroll calculations
   - Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations

2. **Accessibility**
   - Maintain proper contrast ratios
   - Include focus states
   - Add ARIA labels where needed
   - Ensure keyboard navigation

3. **Responsiveness**
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Adaptive animation speeds
   - Conditional rendering for mobile
   - Touch-friendly interactions
